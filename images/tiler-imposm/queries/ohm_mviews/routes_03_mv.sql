-- FUNCTION: create_mv_routes_by_length
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose:
--   Creates a materialized view filtered by minimum geometry length and
--   optionally simplified geometry, based on the source view mv_routes_indexed.
--
--   Includes all route_* columns generated in mv_routes_indexed
--   (up to 6 slots per type: road, train, subway, light_rail, tram, trolleybus, bus),
--   applying NULLIF(..., '') to avoid empty string values.
--
--   Automatically creates:
--     - Unique index on (osm_id, start_decdate, end_decdate)
--     - Spatial GIST index on the geometry column
--
-- Parameters:
--   full_view_name TEXT         - Name of the new materialized view
--   min_length DOUBLE PRECISION - Minimum geometry length (ST_Length filter)
--   simplify_tol DOUBLE PRECISION - Simplification tolerance (ST_Simplify)
--
-- Typical usage:
--   SELECT create_mv_routes_by_length('mv_routes_indexed_z5_6', 500, 500);
--   SELECT create_mv_routes_by_length('mv_routes_indexed_z11_13', 1, 50);
--
-- Notes:
--   - mv_routes_indexed must exist before calling this function.
--   - This function drops the view if it already exists (DROP ... CASCADE).
--   - No LIMIT or dynamic introspection is used: all columns are explicitly listed.
